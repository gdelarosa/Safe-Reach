# Safe-Reach
An LGBTQ+ positive app for those seeking safe spaces in Southern California. Each place is categorized into: community, health, social/housing, and spiritual. The map provides colorized pins for each category and directions using Mapkit. The list view provides more information about each location. 

The app is scheduled to be released to the app store early January 2017.
